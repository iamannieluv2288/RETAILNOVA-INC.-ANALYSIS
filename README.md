METHODOLOGY
•	Data Collection: Historical sales data (2014–2017), transactions, customer segments, geographic details.
•	Visualization: Power BI is used to build interactive charts, KPI cards, and AI insights.
•	Segmentation: By state, category, shipping mode, and customer type.
•	AI Insights: Used Power BI’s Key Influencer visual to identify drivers of sales performance.
•	Filters & Slicers: Implemented to allow users to drill into regions, years, and categories.
KEY INSIGHTS
1.	Sales Performance Over Time: The company’s sales exhibited clear seasonal trends, with notable peaks occurring between March to May and again during the fourth quarter (September to December). This suggests a correlation between consumer demand and seasonal cycles, possibly influenced by promotional events or holidays.

2.	Customer Segment Analysis: Among the three customer segments—Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office—the Consumer segment consistently generated the highest volume of sales throughout the year. This indicates that RetailNova Inc.’s core customer base is primarily composed of individual or household buyers, and further investments in consumer-targeted promotions could yield higher returns.

3.	Sales and Transactions by Day of Week: Sales activity varied significantly across the days of the week, with Tuesdays through Thursdays showing the highest average sales and transaction volumes. Conversely, Sundays and Saturdays recorded the lowest sales figures, indicating that customer engagement is strongest during weekdays and tapers off during the weekend.

4.	Regional Sales Distribution: The analysis revealed that California, New York, and Texas were the top-performing states in terms of total sales, making them the most lucrative markets for RetailNova Inc. In contrast, states like South Dakota, Idaho, and Montana appeared at the bottom of the sales ranking, suggesting either limited market presence, logistical constraints, or lower demand in these areas.


5.	Shipping Mode Usage by State: Across all major states, Standard Class shipping was the most commonly used mode, accounting for over 60% of shipping activity in many regions. Second Class was the next most used, while Same Day and First Class modes were less prevalent. This may reflect customer price sensitivity or limitations in faster delivery logistics.

6.	Multi-Year Sales Growth: Sales figures showed a steady upward trajectory from 2014 to 2017, with total revenue growing from $484,247.50 in 2014 to $733,215.26 in 2017, culminating in a total of $2,297,200.86 across the four years. This demonstrates strong year-over-year growth and signals the company’s expanding market presence.


7.	Transaction Volume Trends: A total of 5,009 transactions were recorded across the entire period, aligning proportionally with the revenue increase each year. This supports the observation that both customer acquisition and retention strategies were improving over time.

8.	Product Category Performance (AI Insights): AI-driven insights from Power BI indicated that sales tend to decline when the primary product category is Office Supplies, especially within sub-categories such as Fasteners, Envelopes, Paper, Labels, and Art Supplies. These items generated significantly lower average sales, suggesting they are either low-demand or low-margin products.


9.	City-Level Distribution and Mapping: Geospatial analysis confirmed that urban centers such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Houston serve as major revenue hubs. These cities also align with states that lead in sales volume, reinforcing the importance of city-specific marketing and distribution strategies.



RECOMMENDATION
•	Enhance Marketing in High-Performing States: RetailNova Inc. should intensify its marketing and promotional efforts in high-performing states such as California, New York, and Texas, as these regions contribute the largest share of total sales. Customized campaigns, localized offers, and loyalty programs in these markets can further drive revenue growth.

•	Address Sales Gaps in Underperforming States: The company should conduct targeted investigations into low-performing states like South Dakota, Idaho, and Montana to determine the root causes of weak sales. Strategic initiatives such as regional promotions, localized advertising, or new distribution partnerships could help penetrate these markets more effectively.

•	Optimize Shipping Strategies for Customer Satisfaction and Efficiency: Given the overwhelming reliance on Standard Class shipping, RetailNova should consider optimizing its logistics network to encourage broader adoption of faster shipping modes, such as Same Day and First Class, especially in metro areas where faster delivery can enhance customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.

•	Leverage Weekday Sales Trends for Promotional Timing: Since sales and transactions peak on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, the company should align major marketing campaigns, flash sales, and product launches with these days to capitalize on peak customer engagement and maximize conversion rates.

•	Reevaluate Low-Performing Product Categories: RetailNova should review its portfolio of underperforming sub-categories, particularly within the Office Supplies category, including Fasteners, Envelopes, and Labels. These items may benefit from being bundled with higher-performing products, rebranded, discounted, or even discontinued if they consistently show weak performance.

•	Strengthen Consumer Segment Engagement: As the Consumer segment is the dominant revenue driver, the company should continue to focus on this group through personalized offers, loyalty rewards, and online engagement campaigns. At the same time, targeted strategies should be developed to increase penetration in Corporate and Home Office segments to diversify revenue sources.

•	Expand Urban Market Presence: Urban areas, especially major cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Houston, demonstrate strong sales potential. RetailNova should explore setting up local fulfillment hubs or expanding partnerships in these cities to reduce delivery times and improve service reliability.
•	[
•	Capitalize on Year-Over-Year Sales Growth: With strong annual growth trends from 2014 to 2017, the company should invest in scaling infrastructure, inventory management systems, and workforce capabilities to support continued expansion and prepare for increased demand in future periods.
